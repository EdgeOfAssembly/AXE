# Collaborative Session Notes

This file is shared between all agents. Use it to:
- Share code snippets (full code - never truncated!)
- Leave notes for other agents
- Track progress on tasks
- Coordinate on complex multi-agent tasks

## Related Collaboration Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.collab_shared.md` | General notes and communication (this file) |
| `.collab_build_status.md` | Build errors/warnings from gcc, make, python |
| `.collab_changes.md` | Diff patches for code changes |
| `.collab_log.md` | Session conversation log (created at end) |

## Agent Coordination

Agents can use these files to:
1. **See build status** - Check `.collab_build_status.md` for current errors/warnings
2. **Claim error fixes** - Volunteer to fix unclaimed issues
3. **Share diffs** - Post code changes as unified diffs in `.collab_changes.md`
4. **Communicate** - Leave notes here for other agents
