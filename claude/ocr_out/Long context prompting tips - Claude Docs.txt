Claudes extended context window (2O0K tokens for Claude 3 models) enables handling
complex, data-rich tasks. This
willhelp you leverage this power effectively:
Essential tips for long context prompts
Put longform data at the top: Place your long documents and inputs (~2OK+ tokens)
near the top of your prompt, above your query, instructions, and examples This can
