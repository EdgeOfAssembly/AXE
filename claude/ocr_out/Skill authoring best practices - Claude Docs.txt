Learn how to write effective Skills that Claude can discover and use
successfully:
page
Good Skills are concise; well-structured, and tested with real usage. This guide provides
practical authoring decisions to
you write Skills that Claude can discover and use
effectively:
For conceptual background on how Skills work, see the Skills overview:
Core principles
Concise is key
The context window is a
public good: Your Skill shares the context window with
everything else Claude needs to know; including:
The system prompt
Conversation history
Other Skills' metadata
Your actual request
Not every token in your Skill has an immediate cost. At startup; only the metadata (name
and description) from all Skills is pre-loaded: Claude reads SKILLmd only when the Skill
becomes relevant; and reads additional files only as needed: However; being concise in
SKILLmd still matters: once Claude loads it, every token competes with conversation
history and other context:
Default assumption: Claude is already very smart
Only add context Claude doesn't already have: Challenge each piece of information:
"Does Claude really need this explanation?"
Ask Docs
"Can
assume Claude knows this?"

a
Library_
There
are many

Set appropriate degrees of freedom
Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:
High freedom (text-based instructions):
Use when:
Multiple approaches are valid
Decisions depend on context

Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters):
Use when:
A

Some variation is acceptable
Configuration affects behavior
Example:
##
Generate report
Use
this

python
def generate_report(data ,
format-"markdown
include_charts-True) :
#
Process
data
#
Generate output
in specified
format
# Optionally
include
visualizations
Low freedom (specific scripts, few or no parameters):
Use when:
Operations are fragile and error-prone
Consistency is critical
A
specific sequence must be followed

Analogy: Think of Claude as a robot exploring a path:
Narrow bridge with cliffs on both sides: There's only one safe Way forward. Provide
specific guardrails and exact instructions (low freedom) Example: database
migrations that must run in exact sequence
Open field with no hazards: Many
lead to success. Give general direction and
trust Claude to find the best route (high freedom) Example: code reviews where
context determines the best approach;
Test with all models you plan to use
Skills act as additions to models, so effectiveness depends on the underlying model, Test
your Skill with all the models you plan to use it with;
Testing considerations by model:
Claude Haiku (fast; economical): Does the Skill provide enough guidance?
Claude Sonnet (balanced): Is the Skill clear and efficient?
Claude Opus (powerful reasoning): Does the Skill avoid over-explaining?
What works perfectly for Opus might need more detail for Haiku: If you plan to use your
Skill across multiple models, aim for instructions that work well with all of them;
Skill structure
YAML Frontmatter: The SKILLmd frontmatter requires two fields:
name
Maximum 64 characters
Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
Ask Docs
Cannot contain XML tags

Must be non-empty
Maximum 1024 characters

Should describe what the Skill does and when to use it
For complete Skill structure details; see the Skills overview:
Naming conventions
Use consistent naming patterns to make Skills easier to reference and discuss. We
recommend
gerund form (verb
+
~ing) for Skill names, as this clearly describes the
activity or capability the Skill provides:
Remember that the
name
field must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only:
Good naming examples (gerund form):
processing-pdfs
analyzing-spreadsheets
managing-databases
testing-code
writing-documentation
Acceptable alternatives:
Noun phrases:
pdf-processing
spreadsheet-analysis
Action-oriented:
process-pdfs
analyze-spreadsheets
Avoid:
Vague names:
heZper
utils
tools
Overly generic:
documents
data
files
Reserved words:
anthropic-helper
claude-tools
Inconsistent patterns within your skill collection

Writing effective descriptions
The
description
field enables Skill discovery and should include both what the Skill
does and when to use it.
Always write in third person: The description is injected into the system prompt,and
inconsistent point-of-view can cause discovery problems.
Good: "Processes Excel files and generates reports"
Avoid: "I can
help you process Excel files"
Avoid: "YoU can use this to process Excel files"
Be
specific and include key terms. Include both what the Skill does and specific
triggerslcontexts for when to use it;
Each Skill has exactly one description field: The description is critical for skill selection:
Claude uses it to choose the right Skill from potentially 100+ available Skills Your
description must provide enough detail for Claude to know when to select this Skill, while
the rest of SKILLmd provides the implementation details.
Effective examples:

Progressive disclosure patterns
SKILLmd serves as an overview that
points Claude to detailed materials as needed, Iike a
table of contents in an onboarding
For an
explanation of how progressive
disclosure works, see How Skills work in the overview:
Practical guidance:
Keep SKILLmd body under 500 lines for optimal performance
Split content into separate files when approaching this limit
Use the patterns below to organize instructions, code; and resources effectively
Visual overview: From Simple to complex
basic Skill starts with just a SKILLmd file containing metadata and instructions:

Pattern 2: Domain-specific organization
For Skills with multiple domains, organize content
domain to avoid loading irrelevant
context. When a User asks about sales metrics, Claude only needs to read sales-related
schemas, not finance or marketing data This keeps token usage low and context focused:

Claude reads REDLINING.md or OOXMLmd only when the user needs those features:
Avoid deeply nested references
Claude may partially read files when they're referenced from other referenced files.
When encountering nested references; Claude might use commands like  heado400
to
preview content rather than reading entire files, resulting in incomplete information:

Structure longer reference files with table of contents
For reference files longer than 100 lines, include a table of contents at the top This
ensures Claude can see the full scope of available information even when previewing with
partial reads.

Evaluation and iteration
Build evaluations first
Create evaluations BEFORE writing extensive documentation: This ensures your Skill
solves real problems rather than documenting imagined ones.
Evaluation-driven development:
1.
Identify gaps: Run Claude on representative tasks without a Skill Document
specific
failures or missing context
2.
Create evaluations: Build three scenarios that test these gaps
3
Establish baseline: Measure Claude's performance without the Skill
4,
Write minimal instructions: Createjust enough content to address the gaps and pass
evaluations
5.
Iterate: Execute evaluations; compare against baseline; and refine
This approach ensures youre solving actual problems rather than anticipating
requirements that may never materialize

This example demonstrates a data-driven evaluation with a simple testing rubric We do not
currently provide a built-in way to run these evaluations Users can create their own
evaluation system. Evaluations are your source of truth for measuring Skill effectiveness.
Develop Skills iteratively with Claude
The most effective Skill development process involves Claude itself Work with one
instance of Claude ("Claude A") to create a Skill that will be used by other instances
("Claude B"). Claude A helps you design and refine instructions, while Claude B tests
them in real tasks. This works because Claude models understand both how to write
effective agent instructions and what information agents need;
Creatinga new Skill:
1.
Completea task without a Skill: Work through a problem with Claude A using normal
prompting: As You work, YoU'Il naturally provide context; explain preferences, and
share procedural knowledge Notice what information yoU repeatedly provide:
2.
Identify the reusable pattern: After completing the task, identify what context YoU
provided that would be useful for similar future tasks.
Example: If you worked through a BigQuery analysis, you might have provided table
names, field definitions, filtering rules (like "always exclude test accounts"), and
common query patterns:
3
Ask Claude A to create a Skill: "Create a Skill that captures this BigQuery analysis
pattern we just used. Include the table schemas, naming conventions, and the rule
II
about filtering test accounts:
Claude models understand the Skill format and structure natively. You don't need
special system prompts or a "writing skills" skill to

4.
Review for conciseness: Check that Claude A hasn't added unnecessary
explanations. Ask: "Remove the explanation about what win rate means
Claude
already knows that:'
5.
Improve information architecture: Ask Claude A to organize the content more
effectively: For example: "Organize this so the table schema is in a separate reference
file: We might add more tables later;'
6
Test on similar tasks: Use the Skill with Claude B (a fresh instance with the Skill
loaded) on related use cases. Observe whether Claude B finds the right information,
applies rules correctly, and handles the task successfully:
7
Iterate based on observation: If Claude B struggles or misses something; return to
Claude A with specifics: "When Claude used this Skill, it forgot to filter by date for
Q4. Should we add a section about date
filtering patterns?"
Iterating on existing Skills:
The same hierarchical pattern continues when improving Skills. You alternate between:
Working with Claude A (the expert who helps refine the Skill)
Testing with Claude B (the agent using the Skill to perform real work)
Observing Claude B's behavior and bringing insights back to Claude A
1.
Use the Skill in real workflows: Give Claude B (with the Skill loaded) actual tasks; not
test scenarios
2.
Observe Claude BIs behavior: Note where it struggles, succeeds, or makes
unexpected choices
Example observation: "When
asked Claude B for a regional sales report, it wrote the
II
query but forgot to filter out test accounts, even though the Skill mentions this rule:'
3
Return to Claude A for improvements: Share the current SKILLmd and describe
what yoU observed. Ask:
noticed Claude B forgot to filter test accounts when |
asked for a regional report: The Skill mentions filtering; but maybe it's not prominent
enough?"
4.
Review Claude A's suggestions: Claude A might suggest reorganizing to make rules
more
prominent; using stronger language like "MUST filter" instead of "always filter",
or
restructuring the workflow section;
5
Apply and test changes: Update the Skill with Claude As refinements, then test
again with Claude B on similar requests
6
Repeat based on usage: Continue this observe-refine-test cycle as

new scenarios Each iteration improves the Skill based on real agent behavior; not

1,
Share Skills with teammates and observe their Usage
2.
Ask: Does the Skill activate when expected? Are instructions clear? What's missing?
3
Incorporate feedback to address blind spots in your own usage patterns
this approach works: Claude A understands agent needs, you provide domain
expertise; Claude B reveals gaps through real usage; and iterative refinement improves
Skills based on observed behavior rather than assumptions.
Observe how Claude navigates Skills
As you iterate on Skills, pay attention to how Claude actually uses them in practice: Watch
for:
Unexpected exploration paths: Does Claude read files in an order YoU didn't
anticipate? This might indicate your structure isn't as intuitive as you thought
Missed connections: Does Claude fail to follow references to important files? Your
links might need to be more
explicit or prominent
Overreliance on certain sections: If Claude repeatedly reads the same file; consider
whether that content should be in the main SKILLmd instead
Ignored content: If Claude never accesses a bundled file; it might be unnecessary or
poorly signaled in the main instructions
Iterate based on these observations rather than assumptions The 'name' and 'description'
in your Skills metadata are particularly critical. Claude uses these when
deciding whether
to trigger the Skill in response to the current task Make sure they clearly describe what
the Skill does and when it should be used;
Anti-patterns to avoid
Avoid Windows-style paths
Always use forward slashes in file paths, even on Windows:
Good:
scripts/helper.pY
reference/guide .md
Avoid:
scripts|helper.pY
reference |guide.md
Unix-style paths work across all platforms, while Windows-style
cause errors on
Unix systems.

Configuration parameters should also bejustified and documented to avoid "voodoo
constants" (Ousterhout's law). If you don't know the right value; how will Claude
determine it?

Bad example: Magic numbers:

# Why

RETRIES
=

# Why

Provide utility scripts
Even if Claude could write a script; pre-made scripts offer advantages:
Benefits of utility scripts:
More reliable than generated code
Save tokens (no need to include code in context)
Save time (no code generation required)
Ensure
consistency across uses

Create verifiable intermediate outputs
When Claude performs complex, open-ended tasks, it can make mistakes  The "plan-
validate-execute" pattern catches errors early by having Claude first create a plan in a
structured format; then validate that plan with a script before executing it:
Example: Imagine asking Claude to update 50 form fields in a PDF based on a
spreadsheet: Without validation, Claude might reference non-existent fields, create
conflicting values, miss required fields, or apply updates incorrectly:
Solution: Use the workflow pattern shown above (PDF form filling), but add an
intermediate
changes. json
file that gets validated before applying changes. The
workflow becomes: analyze
create
plan file
validate plan
execute
verify:
Why this pattern works:
Catches errors early: Validation finds problems before changes are applied
Machine-verifiable: Scripts provide objective verification
Reversible planning: Claude can iterate on the plan without touching originals
Clear debugging: Error messages
to
specific problems
When to use: Batch operations, destructive changes, complex validation rules, high-
stakes operations:
Implementation tip: Make validation scripts verbose with specific error messages like
"Field 'signature_date' not found: Available fields: customer_name; order_total,
signature_date_signed" to help Claude fix issues.
Package dependencies
Skills run in the code execution environment with platform-specific limitations:

How Claude accesses Skills:
1,
Metadata pre-loaded: At startup; the name and description from all Skills' YAML
frontmatter are loaded into the system prompt
2.
Files read on-demand: Claude uses bash Read tools to access SKILLmd and other
files from the filesystem when needed
3
Scripts executed efficiently: Utility scripts can be executed via bash without loading
their full contents into context: Only the scripts output consumes tokens
4.
No context penalty for large files: Reference files, data, or documentation don't
consume context tokens until actually read
File paths matter: Claude navigates your skill directory like a filesystem: Use forward
slashes
reference/guide
md ), not backslashes
Name files descriptively: Use names that indicate content:
form_validation_rules .md
not
doc2.md
Organize for discovery: Structure directories by domain or feature
Good:
reference/finance.md
reference/sales.md
Bad:
docs/ filel.md
docs/ file2.md
Bundle comprehensive resources: Include complete API docs, extensive examples,
large datasets; no context penalty until accessed
Prefer scripts for deterministic operations: Write
validate_form.pY
rather than
asking Claude to generate validation code
Make execution intent clear:
"Run
analyze_form. pY
to extract fields" (execute)
"See
analyze
form.py
for the extraction algorithm" (read as reference)
Test file access
patterns: Verify Claude can navigate your directory structure by
testing with real requests
Example:
bigquery-skill/
SKILL.md
(overview _
points
to
reference
files)
reference/
finance.md
(revenue
metrics)
sales .md
(pipeline

This filesystem-based model is what enables progressive disclosure. Claude can navigate
and selectively load exactly what each task requires:
For complete details on the technical architecture; see How Skills work in the Skills
overview:
MCP tool references
If your Skill uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, always use fully qualified tool
names to avoid "tool not found" errors:
Format:
ServerName:
tool_name
Example:
Use
the BigQuery:bigquery_schema
tool
to
retrieve
table
schemas _
Use
the
GitHub:create_issue
tool
to
create issues 
Where:
BigQuery
and
GitHub
are MCP server names
bigquery_schema
and
create_issue
are the tool names within those servers
Without the server prefix, Claude may fail to locate the tool, especially when multiple
MCP servers are available:
Avoid assuming tools are installed
Don't assume packages are available:
