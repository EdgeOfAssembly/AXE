pricing: Prompt caching offers both 5-minute (default) and 1-hour cache durations to
optimize costs for different use cases:
The table above reflects the following pricing multipliers for prompt caching:
5-minute cache write tokens are 1.25 times the base input tokens price
1-hour cache write tokens are 2 times the base input tokens price
Cache read tokens are 0.1 times the base input tokens price
Third-party platform pricing
Claude models are available on AWS Bedrock; Google Vertex Al, and Microsoft Foundry:

Regional endpoint pricing for Claude 4.5 models and beyond
Starting with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5,AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex Al offer two
endpoint types:
Global endpoints: Dynamic routing across regions for maximum availability
Regional endpoints: Data routing guaranteed within specific geographic regions
Regional endpoints include a 10% premium over
endpoints. The Claude API (IP) is
global by default and unaffected by this change: The Claude API is global-only (equivalent
to the global endpoint offering and pricing from other providers).
Scope: This pricing structure applies to Claude Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5,and all future models.
Earlier models (Claude Sonnet 4, Opus 4,and prior releases) retain their existing pricing:

Long context pricing
When using Claude Sonnet 4 or Sonnet 4.5 with the IM token context window enabled,
requests that exceed 200K input tokens are automatically charged at premium long
context rates:
The IM token context window is currently in beta for organizations in usage tier 4 and
organizations with custom rate limits. The IM token context window is only available for
Claude Sonnet 4 and Sonnet 4.5.

Even with the beta flag enabled, requests with fewer than 2OOK input tokens are charged at
standard rates If your request exceeds 2O0K input tokens, all tokens incur premium pricing:
The 2O0K threshold is based solely on input tokens (including cache reads/writes). Output
token count does not affect pricing tier selection; though output tokens are charged at the
higher rate when the input threshold is exceeded:
To check if your API request was charged at the IM context window rates, examine the
usage
object in the API response:
"usage" :
{
"input_tokens
250000 ,
"cache_creation_input_tokens" :
0 ,
"cache_read_input_tokens" :
0 ,
"output_tokens" :
500
Calculate the total input tokens by summing:
input_tokens
cache_creation_input_tokens
(if using prompt caching)
cache_read_input_tokens
(if
prompt caching)
If the total exceeds 200,000 tokens, the entire request was billed at IM context rates:
For more information about the
usage
object; see the API response documentation;
Tool use pricing
Tool use requests are priced based on:
1.
The total number of input tokens sent to the model (including in the
tools
parameter)
2.
The number of output tokens generated
3
For server-side tools, additional usage-based pricing (e.g , web search charges per
search performed)

Specific tool pricing
Bash tool
The bash tool adds 245 input tokens to your API calls.
Additional tokens are consumed by:
Command outputs (stdoutlstderr)
Error messages
Large file contents
See tool use pricing for complete pricing details.
Code execution tool
Code execution tool usage is tracked separately from token usage: Execution time has a
minimum of 5 minutes If files are included in the request; execution time is billed even if
the tool is not used due to files
preloaded onto the container:
Each organization receives 1,550 free hours of usage with the code execution tool per
month Additional usage beyond the first 1,550 hours is billed at $0.05 per hour; per
container;

Web search is available on the Claude API for $10 per 1,000 searches, plus standard token
costs for search-generated content; Web search results retrieved throughout a
conversation are counted as input tokens; in search iterations executed
during
a
single
turn and in subsequent conversation turns:
Each web search counts as one Use;
regardless of the number of results returned. If an
error OCCUrs
during web search; the web search will not be billed:

The web fetch tool is available on the Claude API at no additional cost, You only pay
standard token costs for the fetched content that becomes part of your conversation
context;
To
protect against inadvertently fetching large content that would consume excessive
tokens; use the
max_content_tokens parameter to set appropriate limits based on your
use case and budget considerations:
Example token usage for typical content:
Average web page (1OKB): ~2,500 tokens
Large documentation page (1OOKB):
~
25,000 tokens
Research paper PDF (SOOKB): ~125,000 tokens

Agent use case pricing examples
Understanding pricing for agent applications is crucial when building with Claude. These
real-world examples can
you estimate costs for different agent patterns:
Customer support agent example
When building a customer support agent;here's how costs might break down:
Example calculation for processing 10,000 support tickets:
Average ~3,700 tokens per conversation
Using Claude Sonnet 4.5at $3/MTok input; $15/MTok output
Total cost: ~s22.20 per 10,000 tickets
For a detailed walkthrough of this calculation, see our customer support agent guide
General agent workflow pricing
For more complex agent architectures with multiple steps:
1.
Initial request processing
Typical input: 500-1,000 tokens
Processing cost: ~s0.003 per request
2.
Memory and context retrieval
Retrieved context: 2,000-5,000 tokens
Cost per retrieval: ~s0.015 per operation
3
Action planning and execution
Planning tokens: 1,000-2,000
Execution feedback: 500-1,000
Combined cost: ~s0.045 per action

comprehensive

agent pricing patterns, see our agent use cases guide:

When building agents with Claude:
1,
Use appropriate models: Choose Haiku for simple tasks, Sonnet for complex
reasoning
2.
Implement prompt caching: Reduce costs for repeated context
3
Batch operations: Use the Batch API for non-time-sensitive tasks
4,
Monitor usage patterns: Track token consumption to identify optimization
opportunities
For high-volume agent applications, consider contacting our enterprise sales team for
custom pricing arrangements

Frequently asked questions
How is token usage calculated?
Tokens are pieces of text that models process. As a rough estimate; 1token is
approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words in English: The exact count varies by language
and content type:
Are there free tiers or trials?
New users receive a small amount of free credits to test the API. Contact sales for
information about extended trials for enterprise evaluation:
How do discounts stack?
Batch API andprompt caching discounts can be combined: For example; using both
features together provides significant cost savings compared to standard API calls.
What payment methods are accepted?
We accept major credit cards for standard accounts Enterprise customers can arrange
invoicing and other payment methods.
