Vision
Claude's vision capabilities allow it to understand and analyze images, opening
up exciting possibilities for multimodal interaction:
page
This
describes how to work with images in Claude; including best practices; code
examples, and limitations to keep in mind;
How to use vision
Use Claudes vision capabilities via:
claudeai; Upload an image like you would a file; or
and
an image directly
into the chat window:
The Console Workbench: A button to add images appears at the
right of every
User message block:
API request; See the examples in this
Before you upload
Basics and Limits
You can include multiple images in a single request (up to 20 for claude.ai and 100 for API
requests). Claude will analyze all provided images when formulating its response: This can
be helpful for comparing or contrasting images:
If you submit an image larger than 8000x8000 px, it will be rejected: If yo'-
than 20 images in one API request; this limit is 2000x2000 pX

Evaluate image size
For optimal performance; we recommend resizing images before uploading if they are too
large. If your images long edge is more than 1568 pixels, or your image is more than ~1,600
tokens; it will first be scaled down; preserving aspect ratio, until it's within the size limits:
If your input image is too large and needs to be resized; it will increase latency of time-to-
first-token, without giving You any additional model performance. Very small images
under 200 pixels on any given edge may degrade performance
To improve time-to-first-token, we recommend resizing images to no more than 1.15
megapixels (and within 1568 pixels in both dimensions)
Here is a table of maximum image sizes accepted by our API that will not be resized for
common aspect ratios With Claude Sonnet 4.5,these images use approximately 1,600
tokens and around s4.80/1K images.
Aspect ratio
Image size
11
1092x1092 px
34
951x1268 pX
23
896x1344 pX
9:16
819x1456 pX
122
784x1568 pX
Calculate image costs
Each image you include in a request to Claude counts towards your token usage: To
calculate the approximate cost, multiply the approximate number of image tokens by the
per-token price of the model youre using:
If your image does not need to be resized, YoU can estimate the number of tokens used
through this algorithm:
tokens
=
(width
pX
X
height px) /750
Here are examples of approximate tokenization and costs for different image sizes within
our API's size constraints based on Claude Sonnet 4.5 per-token price of $3 per million

Ensuring image quality
When providing images to Claude; keep the following in mind for best results:
Image format: Use a supported image format: JPEG, PNG, GIF; or WebP
Image clarity: Ensure images are clear and not too blurry or pixelated;
Text: If the image contains important text, make sure it's legible and not too small;
Avoid cropping out
visual contextjust to enlarge the text;
Prompt examples
of the prompting techniques that work well for text-based interactions with Claude
can also be
applied to image-based prompts
These examples demonstrate best practice prompt structures involving images
Just as with
document-query placement; Claude works best when images come before text;
Images placed after text or interpolated with text will still perform well; but if your use case
allows it, we recommend an image-then-text structure:
About the prompt examples
The
following examples demonstrate how to use Claude's vision capabilities Using various
programming languages and approaches You can provide images to Claude in three ways:
1,
As a base64-encoded image in
image
content blocks
2.
As a URL reference to an image hosted online
3.
Using the Files API (upload once; use multiple times)
The base64 example prompts use these variables:

Limitations
While Claude's image understanding capabilities are cutting-edge; there are some
limitations to be aware of:
People identification: Claude cannot be used to identify (i.e,, name) people in images
and will refuse to do so.
Accuracy: Claude may hallucinate or make mistakes when interpreting loW-quality,
rotated; or very small images under 200 pixels:
Spatial reasoning: Claude's spatial reasoning abilities are limited It may struggle with
tasks requiring precise localization or layouts, like reading an analog clock face or
describing exact positions of chess pieces.
Counting: Claude can give approximate counts of objects in an image but may not
always be precisely accurate; especially with large numbers of small objects.
AI
generated images: Claude does not know if an image is Al-generated and may be
incorrect if asked: Do not rely on it to detect fake or synthetic images
Inappropriate content: Claude will not process inappropriate or explicit images that
violate our Acceptable Use Policy:
Healthcare applications: While Claude can analyze general medical images, it is not
designed to interpret complex diagnostic scans such as CTs or MRIs. Claudes
outputs should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice or
diagnosis.
Always carefully review and verify Claude's image interpretations, especially for high-
stakes use cases. Do not use Claude for tasks requiring perfect precision or sensitive
image analysis without human oversight,
