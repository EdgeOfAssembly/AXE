This guide provides advanced strategies and techniques for getting the most out of
Claude's extended thinking features Extended thinking allows Claude to work through
complex problems step-by-step, improving performance on difficult tasks:
See Extended thinking models for guidance on deciding when to use extended thinking:
Before diving in
This
guide presumes that you have already decided to Use extended thinking mode and
have reviewed our basic steps on how to get started with extended thinking as well as oUr
extended thinking implementation guide:
Technical considerations for extended thinking
Thinking tokens have a minimum budget of 1024 tokens We recommend that YoU
start with the minimum thinking budget and incrementally increase to adjust based
on your needs and task complexity:
For workloads where the optimal thinking budget is above 32K, we recommend that
you Use batch processing to avoid networking issues Requests pushing the model to
think above 32K tokens causes long running requests that might run up against
system timeouts and open connection limits.
Extended thinking performs best in English; though final outputs can be in any
language Claude supports:
If you need thinking below the minimum budget; we recommend using standard
mode; with thinking turned off, with traditional chain-of-thought prompting with XML
tags (like
<thinking  ). See chain of thought prompting:

step instructions
Claude often performs better with high level instructions to just think deeply about a task
rather than step-by-step prescriptive guidance: The model's creativity in approaching
problems may exceed a human's ability to prescribe the optimal thinking process
For example, instead of:
User
Think
through
this
math problem step
by step:
1.
First
identify
the
variables
2 _
Then ,
set
up
the equation
3 _
Next ,
solve
for
X
Consider:
User
Please
think
about
this
math problem thoroughly
and
in great
detail.
Consider multiple approaches
and
show
your complete reasoning _
different methods
if your first approach doesn
t
work _
in Console
That said, Claude can still effectively follow complex structured execution steps when
needed; The model can handle even longer lists with more complex instructions than
previous versions We recommend that you start with more generalized instructions, then
read Claudes thinking output and iterate to provide more specific instructions to steer its
thinking from there
Multishot prompting with extended thinking
Multishot prompting works well with extended thinking: When you provide Claude
examples of how to think through problems,it will follow similar reasoning patterns within
its extended thinking blocks.
You can include feW-shot examples in your prompt in extended thinking scenarios by
using XML tags like
<thinking>
or
<scratchpad>
to indicate canonical patterns of
extended thinking in those examples:

To

Maximizing instruction following with extended thinking
Claude shows significantly improved instruction following when extended thinking is
enabled. The model typically:
1,
Reasons about instructions inside the extended thinking block
2.
Executes those instructions in the response
To maximize instruction following:
Be clear and specific about what YoU want
For complex instructions, consider breaking them into numbered steps that Claude
should work through methodically
Allow Claude enough budget to process the instructions fully in its extended thinking
Using extended thinking to debug and steer Claude's behavior
You can use Claude's thinking output to debug Claudes logic, although this method is not
always perfectly reliable:

as this doesn't improve
performance and may actually degrade results.
Prefilling extended thinking is explicitly not allowed, and manually changing the
model's output text that follows its thinking block is
going to degrade results
due to model confusion;
When extended thinking is turned off; standard
assistant
response text prefill is still
allowed:
Sometimes Claude may repeat its extended thinking in the assistant output text: If you want
a clean response; instruct Claude not to repeat its extended thinking and to only output the
answer:
Making the best oflong outputs and longform thinking
For dataset generation use cases,
prompts such as "Please create an extremely
detailed table of_
for generating comprehensive datasets.
For use cases such as detailed content
generation where you may want to generate
longer extended thinking blocks and more detailed responses,
these tips:
Increase both the maximum extended thinking length AND explicitly ask for longer
outputs
For very long outputs (20,000+ words), request a detailed outline with word counts
down to the paragraph level: Then ask Claude to index its paragraphs to the outline
and maintain the specified word counts
We do not recommend that YOU
Claude to output more tokens for outputting tokens'
sake: Rather; we encourage you to start with a small
thinking budget and increase as needed
to find the optimal settings for your Use case:
Here are example use cases where Claude excels due to longer extended thinking:
Complex STEM problems
Constraint optimization problems

Have Claude reflect on and check its work for improved consistency
and error
handling
You can use
simple natural language prompting to improve consistency and reduce errors:
1,
Ask Claude to verify its work with a simple test before declaring a task complete
2.
Instruct the model to analyze whether its previous
achieved the expected result
3.
For coding tasks,ask Claude to run through test cases in its extended thinking
Example:
User
Write
a
function
to
calculate
the
factorial
of
a
number _
Before
YoU finish ,
pZease
verify
your
solution
with
test
cases
for:
n-0
n=1
n=5
n=10
And
fix
any
issues YOU find.
