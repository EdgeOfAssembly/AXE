Overview
Claude demonstrates robust multilingual capabilities, with particularly strong
performance in zero-shot tasks across languages. The model maintains consistent
relative performance across both widely-spoken and lower-resource languages, making it
a reliable choice for multilingual
applications.
Note that Claude is capable in many languages beyond those benchmarked below: We
encourage testing with any languages relevant to your specific use cases,

With extended thinking:
These metrics are based on MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) English
test sets that were translated into 14 additional languages by
professional human
translators, as documented in OpenAI's simple-evals repository: The use of human
translators for this evaluation ensures high-quality translations, particularly important for
languages with fewer digital resources.
Best practices
When working with multilingual content:
1,
Provide clear language context: While Claude can detect the target language
automatically, explicitly stating the desired inputloutput language improves
reliability: For enhanced fluency, you can prompt Claude to use "idiomatic speech as
if it were a native
speaker:"
2
Use native scripts: Submit text in its native script rather than transliteration for
optimal results
3
Consider cultural context: Effective communication often requires cultural and
regional awareness beyond pure translation
We also suggest following our general prompt engineering guidelines to better improve

Language support considerations
Claude processes input and generates output in most world languages that use
standard Unicode characters
Performance varies by language; with particularly strong capabilities in widely-
spoken languages
Even in languages with fewer digital resources, Claude maintains meaningful
capabilities
