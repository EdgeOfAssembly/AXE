Prompt engineering overview

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to
extended thinking models here:
Before prompt engineering
This guide assumes that you have:
1,
A clear definition of the success criteria for your Use case
2.
Some ways to empirically test against those criteria
3
A first draft prompt you want to improve
If not; we highly suggest you spend time establishing that first: Check out Define your
success criteria and Create strong empirical evaluations for tips and guidance
Prompt generator
Don'thave a first draft prompt? Try the prompt generator in the Claude Consolel
When to prompt engineer
This
focuses on success criteria that are controllable through prompt engineering:
Not every success criteria or failing eval is best solved by prompt engineering: For
example; latency and cost can be sometimes more easily improved by selecting a
different model:

How to prompt engineer
The prompt engineering pages in this section have been organized from most broadly
effective techniques to more
specialized techniques. When troubleshooting
performance; we suggest you try these techniques in order; although the actual impact of
each
technique will depend on your use case.
1.
Prompt generator
2.
Be clear and direct
3
Use examples (multishot)
4,
Let Claude think (chain of thought)
5.
Use XML tags
6.
Give Claude a role
(system prompts)
7
Prefill Claudes response
8.
Chain complex prompts
9.
Long context tips
