Choosing a model
We recommend using the latest Claude Sonnet (4.5) or Claude Opus (4.5) model for
complex tools and ambiguous queries; they handle multiple tools better and seek
clarification when needed,
Use Claude Haiku models for straightforward tools, but note
may infer missing
parameters
If using Claude with tooluse and extended thinking; refer to our guide here for more
information:
Specifying client tools
Client tools (both Anthropic-defined and user-defined) are specified in the
tools
level parameter of the API request: Each tool definition includes:
Parameter
Description
name
The name of the tool. Must match the regex
^
[a-ZA-ZO-9_-]{1,64}$
detailed plaintext description of what the tool does, when it should be used,
description
and how it behaves.
input_schema
AJSON Schema object defining the expected parameters for the tool,
(Optional, beta) An array of example input objects to help Claude understand

When you call the Claude API with the
tools
parameter; we construct a special system
prompt from the tool definitions, tool configuration, and any user-specified system
prompt: The constructed prompt is designed to instruct the model to use the specified
tool(s) and provide the necessary context for the tool to operate properly:

Best practices for tool definitions
To
the best performance out of Claude when using tools, follow these guidelines:
Provide extremely detailed descriptions This is by far the most important factor in
tool
performance: Your descriptions should explain every detail about the tool,
including:
What the tool does
When it should be used (and when it shouldn't)
What each parameter means and how it affects the tools behavior
Any important caveats or limitations, such as what information the tool does not
return if the tool name is unclear The more context YoU can give Claude about
your tools, the better it will be at
deciding when and how to use them: Aim for at
least 3-4 sentences per tool description; more if the tool is complex
Prioritize descriptions, but consider using
input_exampZes
for complex tools:
Clear descriptions are most important; but for tools with complex inputs, nested
objects, or format-sensitive parameters, YoU can use the
input_examples
field
(beta) to provide schema-validated examples See Providing tool use examples for
details.

Providing tool use examples
You can provide concrete examples of valid tool inputs to help Claude understand how to
use your tools more effectively: This is particularly useful for complex tools with nested

Requirements and limitations
Schema validation
Each example must be valid according to the tools
input_schema
Invalid examples return a 400 error
Not supported for server-side tools - Only user-defined tools can have input
examples
Token cost
Examples add to prompt tokens: ~20-50 tokens for simple examples;
~
100-200 tokens for complex nested objects
Toolrunner (beta)
The tool runner provides an out-of-the-box solution for executing tools with Claude:
Instead of manually handling tool calls, tool results, and conversation management; the
tool runner
automatically:
Executes tools when Claude calls them
Handles the requestlresponse cycle
Manages conversation state
Provides type safety and validation
We recommend that yoU use the tool runner for most tool use implementations
The tool runner is currently in beta and available in the Python; TypeScript; and Ruby SDKs.
Automatic context management with compaction
The tool runner supports automatic compaction, which generates summaries when token
usage exceeds a threshold. This allows long-running agentic tasks to continue beyond
context window limits.
Basic usage
Define tools using the SDK helpers, then use the tool runner to execute them:
Python
TypeScript
Ruby

The tool function must return a content block or content block array;
including text;
images, or document blocks. This allows tools to return rich; multimodal responses:
Returned strings will be converted to a text content block: If you want to return a
structured JSON object to Claude; encode it toa JSON string before returningit:
Numbers, booleans, or other non-string primitives must also be converted to strings
Iterating over the tool runner
The tool runner is an iterable that
yields messages from Claude: This is often referred to
as a "tool call loop" . Each iteration; the runner checks if Claude requested a tool use: If s0,
it calls the tool and sends the result back to Claude automatically; then yields the next
message from Claude to continue your
can end the loop at any iteration with a
break
statement; The runner will loop until
Claude returns a message without a tool use:
If you don't need intermediate messages; YOU can

Advanced usage
Within the loop; you can fully customize the tool runner's next request to the Messages
API. The runner automatically appends tool results to the message history, so you don't
need to manually manage them; You can optionally inspect the tool result for logging or
debugging, and modify the request parameters before the next API call;
Python
TypeScript
Ruby
Use
generate_tool_calZ_response ()
to optionally inspect the tool result (the runner
appends it automatically). Use
set_messages_params ()
and
append_messages ()
to
modify the request;

Debugging tool execution
When a tool throws an
exception; the toolrunner catches it and returns the error to
Claude as a tool result with
is_error:
true
By default, only the exception message is
included, not the full stack trace
To view full stack traces and debug information; set the
ANTHROPIC_LoG
environment
variable:
#
View
info-Zevel Zogs including
tool
errors
export
ANTHROPIC_LOG-info
#
View debug-Zevel Zogs
for
more
verbose output
export ANTHROPIC_LOG-debug
When enabled; the SDK logs full exception details (using Python's
Logging
module; the
console in TypeScript; or Ruby's logger), including the complete stack trace when a tool
fails.

By default; toolerrors are passed back to Claude; which can then respond appropriately:
However; YoU may want to detect errors and handle them differently_for example; to
stop execution early or implement custom error handling:
Use the tool response method to intercept tool results and check for errors before
they're sent to Claude:
Python
TypeScript
Ruby
import json
runner
=
client.beta.messages.tool_runner(
model-"claude-sonnet-4-5"
max_tokens-1024 ,
tools= [my_tool]
messages= [ {"role" :

"content":
"Run

for

in
runner:
tool_response
=
runner. generate_tool_calL_response()
if tool_response:
#

for

in
tooL_response.content:
if
bZock.is_error:
#

#

#

print(message. content)
Modifying tool results
You can modify tool results before theyre sent back to Claude This is useful for adding
metadata like

to enable prompt caching on tool results, or for
transforming the tool output:

calls  See Prompt caching for more details on caching strategies.

that YoU can iterate for events;
Python

Controlling Claude's output
Forcing tool use
In some cases; YoU may want Claude to use a
specific tool to answer the user's question;
even if Claude thinks it can provide an answer without using a tool. You can do this by
specifying the tool in the
tool_choice
field like so:
tooL_choice
=
{"type" :
"tool"
"name'
:
"get_weather"}
When working with the tool_choice parameter; we have four possible options:
auto
allows Claude to decide whether to call any provided tools or not: This is the
default value when
tools
are
provided:
any
tells Claude thatit must use one of the provided tools, but doesn't force a
particular tool:
tool
allows Us to force Claude to always Use a
particular tool.
none
prevents Claude from using any tools This is the default value when no
tools
are
provided:

extended thinking with tool use,
tool_choice:
{"type"

in an error: Only
tool_choice:

JSONoutput
Tools do not necessarily need to be client functions
YoU can use tools anytime YOU
want the model to return JSON output that follows a provided schema. For example; You
might use a
record_summary
tool with a
particular schema: See Tool use with Claude for
a full working example
Model responses with tools
When using tools, Claude will often comment on what it's doing or respond naturally to
the user before invoking tools:
For example, given the prompt "What's the weather Iike in San Francisco right now; and
what time is it there?", Claude might respond with:
JSON
"role" :
"assistant"
"content":
[
"type" :
"text"
"text" :
"I

"name" :
"get_weather"
"input" :
{"Location":
"San

}
This natural response style helps users understand what Claude is doing and creates a
more conversational interaction: You can guide the style and content of these responses
through your system prompts and by providing
<examples>
in your prompts:
It's important to note that Claude may use various phrasings and approaches when
explaining its actions Your code should treat these responses like any other assistant-

Parallel tool use
By default; Claude may use multiple tools to answer a user query: You can disable this
behavior by:
Setting
disabZe_parallel_tool_use-true
when tool_choice type is
auto
which
ensures that Claude uses at most one tool
Setting
disable_parallel_tool_use-true
when tool_choice type is
any
or
tool
which ensures that Claude uses exactly one tool
Complete parallel tool use example
Complete test script for parallel tools
Maximizing parallel tooluse
While Claude 4 models have excellent parallel tool use
capabilities by default, you can
increase the likelihood of parallel tool execution across all models with targeted
prompting:
System prompts
parallel tool use
User message prompting
Parallel tool use with Claude Sonnet 3.7
Claude Sonnet 3.7 may be less likely to make make parallel tool calls in a response; even
when you have not set
disable_parallel_tool_use
We recommend upgrading to
Claude 4 models, which have built-in token-efficient tool use and improved parallel tool
calling:
If you're still using Claude Sonnet 3.7, YoU can enable the
token-efficient-tools -
2025-02-19
beta header; which helps encourage Claude to use parallel tools. You can also
introduce a "batch tool" that can act as a meta-tool to wrap invocations to other tools
simultaneously:

Claude's response differs based on whether it uses a client or server tool:
Handling results from client tools
The response will have a

of
tool_use
and one or more
tool_use
content blocks that include:
id
A
unique identifier for this particular tool use block: This will be used to match
up the tool results later:
name
The name of the tool being used.
input
An object containing the input being passed to the tool, conforming to the
tool's

When you receive a tool use response for a client tool;
should:
1,
Extract the
name
id
and
input
from the

block.
2.
Run the actual tool in your codebase corresponding to that tool name; passing in the

"tool_use_id":
"toolu_01"

This is correct:
{"role" :
"user"
"content":
[
{"type":
"tool_result"
"tool_use_id":
"toolu_01"
} _
{"type" :
"text"
"text" :

1I

If yoU receive an error like "tool_use ids were found without tool_result blocks
immediately
after", check that your tool results are formatted correctly:
Example of successful tool result
Example of tool result with images
Example of empty tool result
Example of tool result with documents
After receiving the tool result; Claude will use that information to continue generating a
response to the original user prompt;
Handling results from server tools
Claude executes the tool internally and incorporates the results directly into its response
without requiring additional user interaction;

Unlike APIs that separate tool use or use
special roles Iike
tool
or
function
the
Claude API integrates tools directly into the
user
and
assistant
message structure:
Messages contain arrays of
text
image
tool_Use
and
tooL_result
blocks.
user
messages include client content and
tool_result
while
assistant
messages contain Al-generated content and
tool_use
Handling the
max_tokens
stop reason
If Claude's response is cut off due to
hitting the
max_tokens
limit; and the truncated
response contains an incomplete tool use block, yoU'Il need to retry the request with a
higher
max_tokens
value to
the full tool use.
Python
#
Check
if
response
was
truncated during
tool
Use
if
response.stop_reason
55
"max_tokens"
#
Check
if
the
last
content
bZock
is
an
incomplete tool_Use
Last_bZock
=
response. content[-1]
if Zast_block.type
CS
"tool_use" :
#
Send
the request with higher max_tokens
response
=
client.messages. create(
model="claude-sonnet-4-5"
max_tokens=4096 ,
#
Increased
limit
messages-messages ,
tools-tools
Handling the
pause_turn
stop reason
When using server tools like web search; the API
return a
pause_turn
stop reason;
indicating that the API has paused a long-running turn:
Here's how to handle the
pause_turn
reason:

Modify if needed: You can optionally modify the content before continuing if YoU
want to interrupt or redirect the conversation
Preserve tool state: Include the same tools in the continuation request to maintain
functionality
Troubleshooting errors
Built-in Error Handling: Tool runner provide automatic error handling for most common
scenarios. This section covers manual error
handling for advanced use cases.
There are a few different types of errors that can occur when using tools with Claude:
Tool execution error
Invalid tool name
<search_quality_reflection> tags
Server tool errors
Parallel tool calls not
working
