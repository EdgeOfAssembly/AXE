Use XML tags to structure your prompts
page
While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to
extended thinking models here:
When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and
examples, XML tags can be a game-changer They help Claude parse your prompts more
accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.
XML tip: Use tags like
<instructions>
<example>
and
<formatting>
to clearly
separate different parts of your prompt This prevents Claude from mixing up instructions
with examples or context;
Why use XML tags?
Clarity: Clearly separate different parts of your prompt and ensure your prompt is
well structured:
Accuracy: Reduce errors caused by Claude misinterpreting parts of your prompt;
Flexibility: Easily find, add, remove; or modify parts of your prompt without rewriting
everything:
Parseability: Having Claude use XML tags in its output makes it easier to extract
specific parts of its response by post-processing:
There are no canonical "best" XML tags that Claude has been trained with in particular;
although we recommend that your tag names make sense with the information
surround:

1,
Be consistent: Use the same
names throughout your prompts, and refer to those
names when talking about the content (e.g,
Using
the
contract
in
<contract>
tags _
2.
Nest tags: You should nest tags
<outerz<innerz<linnerz<louter>
for hierarchical
content:
Power user tip: Combine XML tags with other techniques like multishot prompting
<examples>
) or chain of thought
<thinking>
<answer>
) This creates super-
structured, high-performance prompts
Examples
Example: Generating financial reports
Example: Legal contract analysis
