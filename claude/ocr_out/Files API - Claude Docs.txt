The Files API lets yoU upload and manage files to use with the Claude API without re-
uploading content with each request, This is particularly useful when using the code
execution tool to provide inputs (e.g: datasets and documents) and then download
outputs (e-g: charts) You can also use the Files API to prevent having to continually re-
upload frequently used documents and images across multiple API calls. You can explore
the API reference directly; in addition to this
The Files API is currently in beta. Please reach out through our feedback form to share your
experience with the Files API;
Supported models
Referencing a
file_id
in a
Messages request is supported in all models that support
the given file type For example; images are supported in all Claude 3+ models, PDFs in all
Claude 3.5+ models, and various other file types for the code execution tool in Claude
Haiku 4.5 plus all Claude 3.7+ models:
The Files API is currently not supported on Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI;
How the Files APIworks
The Files API provides a simple create-once; use-many-times approach for working with
files:
Upload files to our secure storage and receive a unique
file_id
Download files that are created from skills or the code execution tool
Reference files in Messages requests using the
file_id
instead of re-uploading
content
Manage your files with list; retrieve, and delete operations
