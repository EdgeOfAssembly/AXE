PDF support
Process PDFs with Claude. Extract text, analyze charts, and understand visual
content from your documents:
page
You can now ask Claude about any text; pictures, charts; and tables in PDFs you provide
Some sample use cases:
Analyzing financial reports and understanding charts/tables
Extracting
information from legal documents
Translation assistance for documents
Converting document information into structured formats
Before you begin
Check PDF requirements
Claude works with any standard PDF However; yoU should ensure your request size
meets these requirements when using PDF support:
Requirement
Limit
Maximum request size
32MB
Maximum pages per request
100
Format
Standard PDF (no passwordslencryption)
Please note that both limits are on the entire request payload; including any other content
sent alongside PDFs.
Since PDF support relies on Claude's vision capabilities, it is subject to the same
limitations and considerations as other vision tasks.

PDF supportis currently supported via direct API access and Google Vertex AI. All active
models support PDF processing:
PDF support is now available on Amazon Bedrock with the following considerations:
Amazon Bedrock PDF Support
When Using PDF support through Amazon Bedrock's Converse API, there are two distinct
document processing modes:
Important: To access Claudes full visual PDF
understanding capabilities in the Converse API;
you must enable citations. Without citations enabled, the API falls back to basic text
extraction only: Learn more about working with citations;
Document Processing Modes
1,
Converse Document Chat (Original mode
Text extraction only)
Provides basic text extraction from PDFs
Cannot analyze images, charts, or visual layouts within PDFs
Uses approximately 1,000 tokens for a 3-page PDF
Automatically used when citations are not enabled
2.
Claude PDF Chat (New mode
Full visual understanding)
Provides complete visual analysis of PDFs
Can understand and analyze charts, graphs, images, and visual layouts
Processes each page as both text and image for
comprehensive understanding
Uses approximately 7,000 tokens for a 3-page PDF
Requires citations to be enabled in the Converse API
Key Limitations
Converse API: Visual PDF analysis requires citations to be enabled: There is currently
no
option to use visual analysis without citations (unlike the InvokeModel API)
InvokeModel API: Provides full control over PDF processing without forced citations:

If customers report that Claude isn't seeing images or charts in their PDFs when Using the
Converse API, they likely need to enable the citations flag: Without it; Converse falls back
to basic text extraction only:
This is a known constraint with the Converse API that we're working to address For
applications that require visual PDF analysis without citations, consider using the
InvokeModel API instead.
For non-PDF files like .CSV; xlsx; .docx, .md, or .txt files, see Working with other file formats:
Process PDFs with Claude
Send your first PDF request
Let's start with a simple example using the Messages API; YoU can provide PDFs to Claude
in three ways:
1,
As a URL reference to a PDF hosted online
2.
As a base64-encoded PDF in
document
content blocks
3
By a
file_id
from the Files API
Option 1: URL-based PDF document
The simplest approach is to reference a PDF directly from a URL:

How PDF support works
When yoU send a PDF to Claude; the
following steps occur:
The system extracts the contents of the document;
The system converts each page of the document into an image
The text from each page is extracted and provided alongside each pages
image.
2
Claude analyzes both the text and images to better understand the document;
Documents are provided as a combination of text and images for analysis

Claude responds, referencing the PDF's contents if relevant
Claude can reference both textual and visual content when it responds: YoU can
further improve performance by integrating PDF support with:
Prompt caching: To improve performance for repeated analysis 
Batch processing: For high-volume document processing:
Tool use: To extract
specific information from documents for use as tool inputs.
Estimate your costs
The token count of a PDF file depends on the total text extracted from the document as
well as the number of pages:
Text token costs: Each page typically uses 1,500-3,000 tokens per page depending on
content density Standard API pricing applies with no additional PDF fees.
Image token costs: Since each page is converted into an image; the same image-based
cost calculations are
applied:
You can use token
counting to estimate costs for your specific PDFs.
Optimize PDF processing
Improve performance
Follow these best practices for optimal results:
Place PDFs before text in your requests
Use standard fonts
Ensure text is clear and legible
Rotate pages to proper upright orientation
Use logical page numbers (from PDF viewer) in prompts
Split large PDFs into chunks when needed
Enable prompt caching for repeated analysis
