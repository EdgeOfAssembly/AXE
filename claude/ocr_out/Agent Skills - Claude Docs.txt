Agent Skills
Overview
Agent Skills
Agent Skills are modular capabilities that extend Claudes functionality. Each
Skill packages instructions, metadata, and optional resources (scripts,
templates) that Claude uses automatically when relevant:
page
Why use Skills
Skills are reusable; filesystem-based resources that provide Claude with domain-specific
expertise: workflows, context,and best practices that transform general-purpose agents
into
specialists Unlike prompts (conversation-level instructions for one-off tasks), Skills
load on-demand and eliminate the need to repeatedly provide the same guidance across
multiple conversations.
Key benefits:
Specialize Claude: Tailor capabilities for domain-specific tasks
Reduce repetition: Create once; use automatically
Compose capabilities: Combine Skills to build complex workflows
For a deep dive into the architecture and real-world
applications of Agent Skills, read our
engineering blog: Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills
Using Skills
Anthropic provides pre-built Agent Skills for common document tasks (PowerPoint; Excel,;
Word; PDF) , and yoU can create your own custom Skills. Both work the same way: Claude
automatically uses them when relevant to your request:
Pre-built Agent Skills are available to all users on claude.ai and via the Claude API. See the
Available Skills section below for the complete list;
Custom Skills let you package domain expertise and organizational knov
available across Claude's products: create them in Claude Code; upload them via the API;

How Skills work
Skills leverage Claude's VM environment to provide capabilities beyond what's possible
with prompts alone: Claude operates in a virtual machine with filesystem access, allowing
Skills to exist as directories
containing instructions, executable code; and reference
materials, organized like an onboarding
yoUd create for a new team member
This filesystem-based architecture enables progressive disclosure: Claude loads
information in stages as needed, rather than consuming context upfront:
Three types of Skill content, three levels of
loading
Skills can contain three types of content; each loadedat different times:
Level 1: Metadata (always loaded)
Content type: Instructions. The Skills YAML frontmatter provides discovery information:
name:
pdf-processing
description:
Extract
text
and
tables
from
PDF files ,
fill
forms ,
merge
documen
Claude loads this metadata at startup and includes it in the system prompt: This
lightweight approach means YoU can install many Skills without context penalty; Claude
only knows each Skill exists and when to use it;
Level 2: Instructions (loaded when triggered)
Content type: Instructions. The main body of SKILLmd contains procedural knowledge:
workflows, best practices, and guidance:

## Quick start
Use
pdfplumber
to
extract
text
from
PDFs :
python
import
pdfpZumber
with
pdfpZumber.open( "document. pdf")
as
pdf:
text
=
pages[0].extract_text()
For
advanced
form filling 
see
[FORMS
md] (FORMS . md)
When you request something that matches a Skills description; Claude reads SKILLmd
from the filesystem via bash: Only then does this content enter the context window:
Level 3: Resources and code (loadedas needed)
Content types: Instructions, code, and resources. Skills can bundle additional materials:
pdf-skil/
SKILL.md
(main
instructions)
FORMS . md
(form-filling guide)
REFERENCE
md
(detailed
API
reference)
scripts/
fill_form.pY
(utility
script)
Instructions: Additional markdown files (FORMS.md; REFERENCE.md) containing
specialized guidance and workflows
Code: Executable scripts (fill_form py; validate py) that Claude runs via bash; scripts
provide deterministic operations without consuming context
Resources: Reference materials like database schemas, API documentation; templates; or
examples
Claude accesses these files only when referenced: The filesystem model means each
content type has different strengths: instructions for flexible guidance; code for
reliability, resources for factual lookup:

The Skills architecture
Skills run in a code execution environment where Claude has filesystem access, bash
commands; and code execution
capabilities. Think of it like this: Skills exist as directories
on a virtual machine; and Claude interacts with them
the same bash commands
youd use to navigate files on your computer

How Claude accesses Skill content:
When a Skill is triggered; Claude uses bash to read SKILLmd from the filesystem, bringing
its instructions into the context window: If those instructions reference other files (like
FORMS.md or a database schema), Claude reads those files too using additional bash
commands. When instructions mention executable scripts, Claude runs them via bash
and receives only the output (the script code itself never enters context)

can include dozens of reference files; but if your task only needs the sales schema,
Claude loads just that one file: The rest remain on the filesystem consuming zero tokens.
Efficient script execution: When Claude runs
validate_form. pY
the script's code
never loads into the context window: Only the script's output (like "Validation passed" or
specific error messages) consumes tokens This makes scripts far more efficient than
having Claude generate equivalent code on the fly:
No practical limit on bundled content: Because files don't consume context until
accessed, Skills can include comprehensive API documentation; large datasets, extensive
examples, or any reference materials you need. Theres no context penalty for bundled
content that isn't used:
This filesystem-based model is what makes progressive disclosure work; Claude
navigates your Skill like
reference specific sections of an onboarding guide;
accessing exactly what each task requires
Example: Loading a PDF processing skill
Here's how Claude loads and uses a PDF processing skill:
1,
Startup: System prompt includes:
PDF Processing
Extract
text
and
tables
from
PDF
files 
fill
forms
merge
documents
2.
User request: "Extract the text from this PDF and summarize it"
3.
Claude invokes:
bash:
read pdf-skil /SKILL.md
Instructions loaded into
context
4.
Claude determines: Form filling is not needed; so FORMS.md is not read
5.
Claude executes: Uses instructions from SKILLmd to complete the task

Claude.ai
Claudeai supports both pre-built Agent Skills and custom Skills,
Pre-built Agent Skills: These Skills are already working behind the scenes when yoU
create documents Claude uses them without requiring any setup:
Custom Skills: Upload your own Skills as zip files through Settings > Features. Available on
Pro, Max; Team, and Enterprise
with code execution enabled. Custom Skills are
individual to each user;
are not shared
organization-wide and cannot be centrally
managed by admins;

stated purpose:
If you must use a Skill from an untrusted or unknown source; exercise extreme caution and
thoroughly audit it before use. Depending on what access Claude has when executing the
Skill, malicious Skills could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized system access, or other
security risks:
Key security considerations:
Audit thoroughly: Review all files bundled in the Skill: SKILLmd; scripts, images, and
other resources: Look for unusual patterns Iike unexpected network calls, file access
patterns, or operations that don't match the Skills stated purpose
External sources are risky: Skills that fetch data from external URLs pose particular
risk,as fetched content may contain malicious instructions. Even trustworthy Skills
can be compromised if their external dependencies change over time
Tool misuse: Malicious Skills can invoke tools (file operations bash commands, code
execution) in harmful ways
Data exposure: Skills with access to sensitive data could be designed to leak
information to external systems
Treat like
installing software: Only use Skills from trusted sources. Be especially
careful when integrating Skills into production systems with access to sensitive data
or critical
operations
Available Skills

Limitations and constraints
Understanding these limitations helps you plan your Skills deployment effectively:
Cross-surface availability
Custom Skills do not sync across surfaces. Skills uploaded to one surface are not
automatically available on others:
Skills uploaded to Claude.ai must be separately uploaded to the API
Skills uploaded via the API are not available on Claude.ai
Claude Code Skills are filesystem-based and separate from both Claude.ai and API
You'Il need to manage and upload Skills separately for each surface where YoU want to
use them;
Sharing scope
Skills have different sharing models depending on where yoU use them:
Claude.ai: Individual user
each team member must upload separately
Claude API: Workspace-wide; all workspace members can access uploaded Skills
Claude Code: Personal
~/ . claude/skills/
) or
project-based (
claude/skills/ );
can also be shared via Claude Code Plugins
Claudeai does not currently support centralized admin management or org-wide
distribution of custom Skills:
Runtime environment constraints
The exact runtime environment available to your skill depends on the product surface
where you use it;
Claude.ai:
Varying network access: Depending on userladmin settings, Skills may have full;
partial, or no network access For more details, see the Create and Edit Files

cannot install new packages during execution:
Pre-configured dependencies only: Check the code execution tool
documentation for the list of available packages
Claude Code:
Full network access: Skills have the same network access as any other program
on the user's computer
Global package installation discouraged: Skills should only install packages
locally in order to avoid interfering with the users computer
