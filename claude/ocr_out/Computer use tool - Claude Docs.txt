Claude can interact with computer environments through the computer use tool, which
provides screenshot capabilities and mouselkeyboard control for autonomous desktop
interaction;
Computer use is currently in beta and requires a beta header:
computer-use-2025-11-24
for Claude Opus 4.5
H
computer-use-2025-01-24'
for Claude Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5, Opus 4.1, Sonnet 4,
Opus 4,and Sonnet 3.7 (deprecated)
Please reach out through our feedback form to share your feedback on this feature:
Overview
Computer use is a beta feature that enables Claude to interact with desktop
environments. This tool provides:
Screenshot capture: See what's currently displayed on screen
Mouse control: Click, drag; and move the cursor
Keyboard input: Type text and use keyboard shortcuts
Desktop automation: Interact with any application or interface
While computer use can be augmented with other tools like bash and text editor for more
comprehensive automation workflows, computer use specifically refers to the computer
use tool's capability to see and control desktop environments.
Model compatibility
Computer use is available for the following Claude models:

tool version with new
capabilities
including the zoom action for detailed screen region inspection: All other models (Sonnet
4.5, Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4, Opus 4, Opus 4.1,and Sonnet 3.7) use the
computer_20250124
tool version:
Older tool versions are not
guaranteed to be backwards-compatible with newer models
Always use the tool version that corresponds to your model version:
Security considerations
Computer use is a beta feature with unique risks distinct from standard API features
These risks are heightened when interacting with the internet;
To minimize risks, consider taking precautions such as:
1,
Using a dedicated virtual machine or container with minimal privileges to prevent direct
system attacks or accidents.
2
Avoiding giving the model access to sensitive data; such as account login information;
to prevent information theft;
3
Limiting internet access to an allowlist f domains to reduce exposure to malicious
content;
4
Asking a human to confirm decisions that may result in meaningful real-world
consequences as well as any tasks requiring affirmative consent; such as accepting
cookies, executing financial transactions, or agreeing to terms of service
In some circumstances, Claude will follow commands found in content even if it conflicts
with the user's instructions. For example; Claude instructions on webpages or contained
in images may override instructions or cause Claude to make mistakes We suggest taking
precautions to isolate Claude from sensitive data and actions to avoid risks related to
prompt injection;
We've trained the model to resist these prompt injections and have added an extra layer
of defense: If you use our computer use tools, we'Il automatically run
classifierson yci;
prompts to flag potential instances of prompt injections. When these classifiers identify

extra protection won't be Ideal tor every use case (tor example; Use cases Without a
human in the loop), so if youd like to opt out and turn it off, please contact Us:
We still suggest taking precautions to isolate Claude from sensitive data and actions to
avoid risks related to prompt injection
Finally; please inform end users of relevant risks and obtain their consent
to enabling
computer use in your own products.

Claude decides to use the computer use tool
Claude assesses if the computer use tool can help with the user's query:
If yes, Claude constructs a properly formatted tool use request;
The API response has a
stop_reason
of
tool_use
signaling Claudes intent;
3
Extract tool input, evaluate the tool on a computer; and return results
On your end; extract the tool name and input from Claude's request;
Use the tool on a container or Virtual Machine.
Continue the conversation with a new
user
message containing a
tool_result
content block
4
Claude continues calling computer use tools until it's completed the task
Claude analyzes the tool results to determine if more tool use is needed or the
task has been completed;
If Claude decides it needs another tool,it responds with another
tool_use
stop_reason
and yoU should return to step 3.
Otherwise, it crafts a text response to the User
We refer to the
repetition of steps 3 and 4 without user input as the "agent loop"
-
i.e;,
Claude responding with a tool use request and your
application responding to Claude
with the results of
evaluating that request.
The computing environment
Computer use requires a sandboxed computing environment where Claude can safely
interact with
applications and the web: This environment includes:
1,
Virtual display: A virtual X1I display server (using Xvfb) that renders the desktop
interface Claude will see through screenshots and control with mouse/keyboard
actions.
2.
Desktop environment: A lightweight Ul with window manager (Mutter) and panel
(Tint2) running on Linux, which provides a consistent graphical interface for Claude
to interact with:
3.
Applications: Pre-installed Linux applications like Firefox; LibreOfficetexteditcrs,
Ask
and file managers that Claude can use to complete tasks.

virtual environment;
5.
Agent loop: A program that handles communication between Claude and the
environment; sending Claude's actions to the environment and returning the results
(screenshots, command outputs) back to Claude:
When you use computer use; Claude doesn't directly connect to this environment;
Instead, your
application:
1,
Receives Claude's tool use requests
2.
Translates them into actions in your computing environment
3
Captures the results (screenshots, command outputs, etc)
4.
Returns these results to Claude
For security and isolation; the reference implementation runs all of this inside a Docker
container with appropriate port mappings for viewing and interacting with the
environment;
How to implement computer use
Start with our reference implementation
We have built a reference implementation that includes everything you need to
started quickly with computer Use:
containerized environment suitable for computer use with Claude
Implementations of the computer use tools
An agent loop that interacts with the Claude API and executes the computer use
tools
A web interface to interact with the container; agent loop, and tools.
Understanding the multi-agent loop
The core of computer use is the "agent loop"
-
a
cycle where Claude requests tool actions,
your
application executes them, and returns results to Claude: Here's a simplified

Optimize modelperformance with prompting
Here are some tips on how to
the best quality outputs:
1,
Specify simple; well-defined tasks and provide explicit instructions for each
2.
Claude sometimes assumes outcomes of its actions without explicitly checking their
results. To prevent this YoU can prompt Claude with
After
each step ,
take
a
screenshot
and carefully

if
YOU
have
achieved
the
right outcome _
Explicitly
show
your thinking:

successful outcomes in your prompt;
5.
If you need the model to log in, provide it with the username and password in your
prompt inside xml tags like
<robot_credentials>
Using computer use within
applications that require login increases the risk of bad outcomes asa result of
prompt injection. Please review our
on
mitigating prompt injections before
providing the model with login credentials:
If you repeatedly encounter a clear set of issues or know in advance the tasks Claude will
need to
complete; use the system prompt to provide Claude with explicit tips or instructions
on how to do the tasks successfully:
System prompts
When one of the Anthropic-defined tools is requested via the Claude API,a computer
use-specific system prompt is generated It's similar to the tool use system prompt but
starts with:
You have access toa set of functions YoU can use to answer the user's question. This
includes access to a sandboxed computing environment; You do NOT currently have the
ability to inspect files or interact with external resources; except by invoking the below
functions;
As with regular tool use, the user-provided
system_prompt
field is still respected and
used in the construction of the combined system prompt

Claude Sonnet 3.7 introduced a new "thinking" capability that allows yoU to see the
model's reasoning process as it works through complex tasks. This feature helps YOU
understand how Claude is approaching a problem and can be particularly valuable for
debugging or educational purposes
To enable thinking; add a
thinking  parameter to your API request:
I
thinking"
"type" :
"enabled"
I
budget_tokens" :
1024
}
The
budget_tokens parameter specifies how many tokens Claude can use for thinking:
This is subtracted from your overall
max_tokens
budget;
When thinking is enabled; Claude will return its reasoning process as part of the
response; which can help you:
1.
Understand the model's decision-making process
2.
Identify potential issues or misconceptions
3
Learn from Claude's approach to problem-solving
4.
Get more visibility into complex multi-step operations

Build a custom computer use environment
The reference implementation is meant to help YoU
started with computer use. It
includes all of the components needed have Claude use a computer: However; YoU can
build your own environment for computer use to suit your needs: You'Il need:
A
virtualized or containerized environment suitable for computer use with Claude
An implementation of at least one of the Anthropic-defined computer use tools
An agent
that interacts with the Claude API and executes the
tool_use
results
using your tool implementations
An API or Ul that allows user input to start the agent loop
Implement the computer use tool
The computer use tool is implemented as a schema-less tool. When using this tool, YOU
don't need to provide an input schema as with other tools; the schema is built into
Claude's model and can't be modified,
Set up your computing environment
Create a virtual display or connect to an existing display that Claude will interact
with; This typically involves setting up Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) or similar
technology:

When implementing the computer use tool, various errors may occur: Heres how to
handle them:
Screenshot capture failure
Invalid coordinates
Action execution failure
Handle coordinate scaling for higher resolutions
The API constrains images to a maximum of 1568 pixels on the longest edge and
approximately 1.15 megapixels total (see image resizing for details). For example; a
1512x982 screen gets downsampled to approximately 1330x864. Claude analyzes this
smaller image and returns coordinates in that space; but your tool executes clicks in the
original screen space.
This can cause Claude's click coordinates to miss their targets unless you handle the
coordinate transformation;
To fix this, resize screenshots yourself and scale Claudes coordinates back up:

Computer use tool

The computer use functionality is in beta While Claude's capabilities are cutting edge;
developers should be aware of its limitations:
1,
Latency: the current computer use latency for human-Al interactions may be too
slow compared to regular human-directed computer actions. We recommend
focusing on use cases where speed isn't critical (e.g, background information
gathering; automated software testing) in trusted environments
2.
Computer vision accuracy and reliability: Claude may make mistakes or hallucinate
when outputting specific coordinates while generating actions. Claude Sonnet 3.7
introduces the thinking capability that can help You understand the model's
reasoning and identify potential issues.
3
Tool selection accuracy and reliability: Claude may make mistakes or hallucinate
when selecting tools while generating actions or take unexpected actions to solve
problems. Additionally, reliability may be lower when interacting with niche
applications or multiple applications at once: We recommend that users prompt the
model carefully when requesting complex tasks
4,
Scrolling reliability: Claude Sonnet 3.7 introduced dedicated scroll actions with
direction control that improves reliability: The model can now explicitly scroll in any
direction (upldown/leftlright) by a specified amount;
5.
Spreadsheet interaction: Mouse clicks for spreadsheet interaction have improved in
Claude Sonnet 3.7 with the addition of more precise mouse control actions like
Left_mouse_down
Left_mouse_up
and new modifier
support: Cell selection
can be more reliable by using these fine-grained controls and combining modifier
keys with clicks.
6.
Account creation and content generation on social and communications platforms:
While Claude will visit websites, we are limiting its ability to create accounts or
generate and share content or otherwise engage in human impersonation across
social media websites and platforms. We may
this capability in the future:
7
Vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities like jailbreaking or prompt injection may persist across
frontier Al systems, including the beta computer use API: In some circumstances,
Claude will follow commands found in content, sometimes even in conflict with the
user's instructions For example; Claude instructions on webpages or contained in
images may override instructions or cause Claude to make mistakes. We recommend:
a
Limiting computer use to trusted environments such as virtual machines or
containers with minimal privileges b. Avoiding giving computer use access to
sensitive accounts or data without strict oversight C. Informing end users of relevant
risks and obtaining their consent before enabling or requesting permissions
necessary for computer use features in your applications

Always carefully review and verify Claude's computer use actions and logs. Do not use
Claude for tasks requiring perfect precision or sensitive user information without human
oversight;
Pricing
Computer use follows the standard tool use pricing: When using the computer use tool:
System prompt overhead: The computer use beta adds 466-499 tokens to the system
prompt
Computer use tool token Usage:
Model
Input tokens per tool definition
Claude 4.X models
735 tokens
Claude Sonnet 3.7 (deprecated)
735 tokens
Additional token consumption:
Screenshot images (see Vision pricing)
Tool execution results returned to Claude
If you're also using bash or text editor tools alongside computer use; those tools have their
own token costs as documented in their respective pages:
