Chain complex prompts for stronger performance

While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to
extended thinking models here:
When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you
to
handle everything in a single prompt Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great; but what
if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?
Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller; manageable subtasks.
Why chain prompts?
1,
Accuracy: Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors
2.
Clarity: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs:
3.
Traceability: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.
When to chain prompts
Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or
iterative content creation: When a task involves multiple transformations, citations; or
instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps;
Remember: Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attentionl
Debugging tip: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own
prompt: This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task

1,
Identify subtasks: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2.
Structure with XML for clear handoffs: Use XML tags to pass outputs between
prompts:
3.
Have a
single-task goal: Each subtask should have a single; clear objective:
4.
Iterate: Refine subtasks based on Claudes performance:
Example chained workflows:
Multi-step analysis: See the legal and business examples below:
Content creation pipelines: Research
Outline
Draft
Edit
Format;
Data processing: Extract
Transform
Analyze
Visualize.
Decision-making: Gather info
List options
Analyze each
Recommend:
Verification loops: Generate content
Review
Refine
Re-review:
Optimization tip: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create
separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.
Advanced: Self-correction chains
You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own workl This catches errors and
refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks
Example: Self-correcting research summary
Examples
Example: Analyzing a legal contract (without chaining)
Example: Analyzing a legal contract (with chaining)
