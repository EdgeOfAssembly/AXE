While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to
extended
thinking models here:
When faced with complex tasks like research, analysis, or problem-solving, giving Claude
space to think can dramatically improve its performance This technique; known as chain
of thought (CoT) prompting; encourages Claude to break down problems step-by-step;
leading to more accurate and nuanced outputs
Before implementing CoT
Why let Claude think?
Accuracy: Stepping through problems reduces errors, especially in math, logic,
analysis, or generally complex tasks
Coherence: Structured thinking leads to more cohesive; well-organized responses;
Debugging: Seeing Claudes thought process helps you pinpoint where prompts may
be unclear;
Why not let Claude think?
Increased output length may impact latency:
Not all tasks require in-depth thinking: Use CoT judiciously to ensure the right
balance of performance and latency:
Use CoT for tasks that a human would need to think through; like complex math; multi-step
analysis, writing complex documents, or decisions with many factors

How to prompt for thinking
The chain of thought techniques below are ordered from least to most complex: Less
complex methods take up less space in the context window; but are also generally less
powerful:
CoT tip: Always have Claude output its thinking Without outputtingits thought process, no
thinking occursl
Basic prompt: Include "Think step-by-step" in your prompt
Lacks guidance on how to think (which is especially not ideal if a task is
specific to your app; use case, or organization)
Example: Writing donor emails (basic CoT)
Guided prompt: Outline specific steps for Claude to follow in its thinking process.
Lacks structuring to make it easy to strip out and separate the answer from the
thinking:
Example: Writing donor emails (guided CoT)
Structured prompt: Use XML tags like
<thinking>
and
<answer>
to
separate
reasoning from the final answer:
Example: Writing donor emails (structured guided CoT)
Examples
Example: Financial analysis without thinking
Example: Financial analysis with thinking
