Learn how to use Agent Skills to create documents with the Claude API in under
10 minutes;

This tutorial shows YoU how to use Agent Skills to create a PowerPoint presentation: You'Il
learn how to enable Skills, make a simple request; and access the generated file:
Prerequisites
Anthropic API
Python 3.7+ or curl installed
Basic familiarity with making APl requests
What are Agent Skills?
Pre-built Agent Skills extend Claude's capabilities with specialized expertise for tasks like
creating documents, analyzing data; and processing files Anthropic provides the
following pre-built Agent Skills in the API:
PowerPoint (pptx): Create and edit presentations
Excel (xlsx): Create and analyze spreadsheets
Word (docx): Create and edit documents
PDF (pdf): Generate PDF documents
Want to create custom Skills? See the Agent Skills Cookbook for examples of building your
own Skills with domain-specific expertise:
Step 1:List available Skills
First; let's see what Skills are available: We'Il use the Skills API to list all A

You see the
following Skills:
xlsx
docx
and
pdf
This API returns each Skill's metadata: its name and description. Claude loads this
metadata at startup to know what Skills are available This is the first level of progressive
disclosure; where Claude discovers Skills without loading their full instructions
Step 2: Create a presentation
Now we'Il use the PowerPoint Skill to create a presentation about renewable energy: We
specify Skills using the

Beta headers:

and

When you make this request; Claude automatically matches your task to the relevant
Skill: Since you asked for a presentation; Claude determines the PowerPoint Skill is
relevant and loads its full instructions: the second level of progressive disclosure. Then
Claude executes the Skill's code to create your presentation:
