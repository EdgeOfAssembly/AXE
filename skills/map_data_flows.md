Skill: map_data_flows
Category: Legacy Code Archaeology
Recommended agents: llama + claude
Purpose: Identify and track key data structures early (globals, segment:offset, stack, PSP fields, DOS memory blocks) — before diving into logic

Typical inputs: Suspected addresses, string/xref locations, memory dumps
Outputs: Data-centric overview + read/write relationships map
Why especially valuable in AXE: Often the fastest way to understand old DOS programs
